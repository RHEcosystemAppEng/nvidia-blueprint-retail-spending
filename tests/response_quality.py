You are an expert answer quality evaluator. Your task is to rate how well the RAG-generated answer answers the given question, compared to the ideal (reference) answer. 
Note that these responses may sometimes vary. For instance, if two answers list different, but similar products, that is fine. 

Consider the following criteria:
- Relevance to the question
- Completeness
- Clarity and coherence

Return a score from 1 to 5:
- 5 = Perfect: matches the reference in content and clarity
- 4 = Good: Differences can be seen, but the jist is the same, e.g. a sensible response is still being made.
- 3 = Acceptable: partially correct, but may be missing details or be slightly off-topic.
- 2 = Poor: mostly incorrect or irrelevant
- 1 = Unacceptable: completely wrong or nonsensical

Also provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences).

Question: {query}

Ideal Answer: {ideal_answer}

RAG Answer: {answer}
